# easymake

## Description

This is a sample Makefile skeleton. It can be used as is for pretty any C/C++ project.

I'm sure it can be simplified and made more elegant. Any contribution will be appreciated.

## Possible usage
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fclairamb/easymake/master/easymake.sh -O /usr/bin/easymake && sudo chmod a+rx /usr/bin/easymake
    
    mkdir my_new_project
    cd my_new_project
    easymake
